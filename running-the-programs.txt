#what you need

a text file with all the commands that need to be run split by newlines.

#how to run
##server.py
The server has been updated to use argparse, and the command descriptions are pretty self explanitory (port, command-file, etc).
Note though, that the --working-directory and --log-file flag currently does not do anything.

##client.py
This one gets a little trickier.
Since it has not been updated, it must be configured using the `config.py` source file.
Because of this, you basically need to make your own copy of the repo to run this software as not to interfere with other people.

###Noteable things that need configuring

server_port: port for server
server_ip: address for the server. Can use things like 'hltrun01'.

working_directory: the directory the program should change to before running commands. For example, commands that involve run-sbt being called, you need to move to the correct source folder beforehand.

cmd_timeout: the maximum time allowed for a command to run in seconds. After the specified number of seconds have passed the execution will be terminated, and an error code is returned to the server.

output_prefix: stderr and stdout for each command run get written to files in the folder specified here (e.g. cmd-00001-stdout.txt)
padding: the number of digits each number should have. this is to make the commands appear in order for sorted lists. (e.g. 02 instead of 2 so that the 10th command does not appear before the 2nd command when listing the files)

###Unused options for client
log_file
wd_is_list
