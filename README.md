#cmd_queue
##What the program does

This program serves commands to clients to run over a network.

Commands are delivered on a first come first serve basis.

I made this program with Python version 3.4.

While it may work with other versions I have not tested any of them.

##Running the Program
To setup the program first copy defaults.py to config.py

Then edit config.py and run the programs 

typing 'exit' and hitting enter will queue the server/client to terminate
